            <p>Our team’s name is Rumi, it consists of 4 students, Dimash, Bakdaulet, Ali, Bekzhan. We worked on this project since the start of December, first thing we did when started this project was dividing tasks between each other. For that  “Trello” and “Telegram” were very helpful,  it helped to manage tasks online and was very comfotable because we were working online. Most technical tasks were done by Mr. Dimash and Mr. Ali and tasks like presentation and documentation were done by Mr. Bekzhan and Mr. Bakdaulet. All difficulties were solved by team consulting in telegram platform, and some issues of our projects were mentioned by our lecturer and were corrected immediately.</p>

            <p> We created such website in order to simplify tasks of enrolling into course by making it online. Because, usually people are not able to get info about one school without visiting it and studying there for about a month. This takes much time which is priceless resource for pupils at the time of preparation.
                So our website enables users to see details about course and other info such as teachers, course prices, what subjects it contain, lesson’s duration, our contact numbers, addresses online. It is free for use, and affordable for everyone who has access to the internet. In the main page people can see the video from youtube about our course which is essential for any school. Our website also eases tasks of this school’s owners. Because making those processes online saves a lot of time and money. Pupils can enrol themselves to trial lesson. </p>
